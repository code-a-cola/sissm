Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
PIGATEWAY Plugin
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.09.03

PIGATEWAY is a plugin that watches who connects to your server.  This plugin manages
Admin ports (reserved ports) so admins can join on a full server.  It is also capable of 
auto-kicking profanity-named players upon attempted connection.

PIGATEWAY relies on two files cotaining the list of SteamID64s: badnames.txt and admins.txt.
The paths to these files are defined in sissm.cfg:




=====================
Enabling Admin Ports
=====================

The admin port algorithm used by pigateway plugin works by setting parameters in three places:

1.  "Advertised" ports - this is what is in your game launch "traveler" parameter, for example

"Town?Scenario=Scenario_Hideout_Checkpoint_Security?MaxPlayers=8"

This is what you want to allow 'public' to see, and use.

2.  "Allocated" ports - this is controlled by UE4.  You set this in the Engine.ini
file while the server is not running (otherwise, it will overwrite your changes).  Engine.ini
location can vary but generally they are like so:

Windows (example):
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\sandstorm_server\Insurgency\Saved\Config\WindowsServer\Engine.ini
Linux (example):
/home/ins/ss/Insurgency/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/Engine.ini

Edit the Engine.ini file to add this to end.

[SystemSettings]
net.MaxPlayersOverride=12

This enables up to 12 people to join the server, even though the game browser only shows 8.

3.  Sissm.cfg file - To keep regular players from joining to your slots 9 through 12, 
you tell SISSM to watch for that.  In yous sissm.cfg file set:

pigateway.pluginState                 1                 // 1=enable plugin, 0=disable plugin
pigateway.firstAdminSlotNo            9        // first open slot# non-admins will be kicked

This tells SISSM that everything above slot 9 is for Admins only.  When the 9th player tries to connect,
SISSM will look up the SteamID (typically Admins.txt).  If the player is not on the list, s/he is 
kicked with the message "Server_Full" (and it realy is, as indicated in the game browser).

What this also means is that when an Admin sees 8/8 full on the game browser, s/he may be able to join.
Up to 4 additional ports can be taken by additional admins.

Adjust the numbers to meet your needs.

=====================
Enabling Bad Name Kick
=====================

If you enable the badname kick option, SISSM looks up the new connecting player name
and compares it against the 'profanity name' list.  Players with profanity embedded
in their name will be kicked by SISSM.

Currently there is no plan to incorporate content filtering for in-game chat.  This is why:

a.  The game itself is profanity laced by the manufacturer - in voice announcement 
    as well as "tips" in opening page.  NWI seems to have future plans for profanity 
    filter (unconfirmed).
b.  Players naming themselves w/ profanity or vulgar sexual references are likely 
    to exhibit problematic behavior to the community.
c.  For tactical servers it is important to address players by posted name.  It is not
    appropriate to call someone with profanity in name, or racist or sexual references.

Here are the 3 steps to make the bad names filtering to work:

1.  Create your own badwords.txt

Create a file 'badwords.txt' somewhere on your drive that can be read by sissm at startup.
The bad words should be entered one word per line, in lower case.  Comments are NOT
supported:

-----------------
fudge
shoot
bucko
jeepers
-----------------

2.  Point your sissm.cfg file to the bad words list you created, example:

Windows (example):
sissm.BadWordsFilePath     "/home/ins/sissm/badwords.txt"
 
Linux (example):
sissm.BadWordsFilePath     "C:\text\badwords.txt"


3. Turn on the badword filter on sissm.cfg 

pigateway.pluginState                 1                 // 1=enable plugin, 0=disable plugin
pigateway.enableBadNameFilter         1        // 1=enable kick on profanity names 0=disable

This feature merely kicks bad-named players without specifying the reason.  This is done
intentionally to discourage people from modiifying one or two letters in their name
to circumvent the algorithm.

4.  Restart SISSM.  

You should see, in the first few lines of log, something like this::

    2019-09-13 09:37:45::api::BadWords list 121 words from file /home/ins/scripts/badwords.txt

If you see values like "0" or "-1", check your file path in sissm.cfg.
