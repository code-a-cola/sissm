1.  picladmin block:  Changed all default fun-responses to be shorter (fits on one line)

2.  Added bad words file path variable.  Simply add profanity words here, one word per line.
A (clean) example badwords.txt file is in the release package.  This is used to compare against
connecting player name.  If the bad-name plugin is enabled, the user is kicked.  To obtain
the horrific version of badwords.txt used by the author of this package, contact me via 
Steam ("shroeder_lvb"), Discord "Shchroeder#7524", or email: schroeder-lvb@outlook.com).
